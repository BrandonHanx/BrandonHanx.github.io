My expertise includes but not limited to\n Visionâ€‘language preâ€‘training and (parameterâ€‘efficient) adaptation; Visionâ€‘language downstream tasks (e.g., uni-/crossâ€‘/multi-modal image retrieval, image captioning, textâ€‘based/guided 2D/3D contents generation/editing); Some specific tasks (e.g., person ReID).
